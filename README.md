   ```sql
   -- Temporarily disable RLS for testing (optional)
   ALTER TABLE likes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

#### Database Features Included:

## üîß Development

### Adding New Components

To add new components with dark mode support:

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/theme";

export function NewComponent() {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        "bg-white dark:bg-gray-900",
        "text-gray-900 dark:text-white"
      )}
    >
      {/* Your component content */}
    </div>
  );
}
````

### Adding New Notification Types

1. Update notification types in `lib/types.ts`:

```typescript
export type NotificationType =
  | "like"
  | "comment"
  | "request"
  | "request_approved"
  | "request_rejected"
  | "pickup_confirmed"
  | "new_type";
```

2. Add notification function in `lib/utils.ts`:

```typescript
export async function notifyNewType(
  userId: string,
  message: string,
  relatedId?: string
) {
  return createNotification(userId, "new_type", message, relatedId);
}
```

3. Update notification display in `NotificationItem.tsx` to handle new type

### Database Migrations

If you need to modify database schema:

1. Update `supabase-schema.sql`
2. Apply changes in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Update TypeScript types in `lib/database.types.ts`
4. Test notification system after schema changes

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in appropriate `/components` subdirectory
2. Add pages in `/app` directory using App Router conventions
3. Update types in `/lib/types.ts`
4. Add utility functions in `/lib/utils.ts`
5. Implement dark mode classes using theme utilities
6. Add notifications if feature requires user interaction

## üì¶ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
3. Configure build settings:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
4. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Other Hosting Platforms

Ensure your hosting platform supports:

- Node.js 18+ with App Router support
- Environment variables configuration
- Static file serving for images
- HTTPS (required for camera access)
- WebSocket connections for real-time features

### Production Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**:

   - Enable RLS policies for production
   - Configure proper indexes for performance
   - Set up regular backups

2. **Storage Configuration**:

   - Configure CDN for faster image loading
   - Set proper file size limits
   - Implement image optimization

3. **Security**:
   - Never expose service role key in client code
   - Configure CORS policies
   - Enable HTTPS redirects
   - Set up rate limiting

## üö® Important Notes

### Security Considerations

- **Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`** in client-side code
- **RLS policies** enforced at database level for data protection
- **File uploads** restricted to authenticated users only
- **QR codes** are single-use and expire after collection
- **Theme preferences** stored locally, do not expose sensitive data
- **Notifications** only for same RT members

### Performance Considerations

- **Real-time subscriptions** optimized for specific RT only
- **Image uploads** compressed automatically
- **Notification queries** indexed for fast retrieval
- **Theme switching** uses CSS custom properties for smooth transitions
- **Component lazy loading** for faster initial page load

### Limitations

- One RT per user (by design for community focus)
- Photo storage limited by Supabase plan (upgrade if needed)
- QR scanner requires HTTPS in production (browser security requirement)
- Notification real-time updates require stable internet connection
- Dark mode requires modern browser support for CSS custom properties

### Browser Support

- **Modern browsers** with ES6+ support
- **Camera access** for QR scanning (requires HTTPS)
- **LocalStorage** for theme persistence
- **WebSocket** for real-time notifications
- **CSS Custom Properties** for dynamic theming

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
3. Implement feature with proper dark mode support
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Test notification system if feature affects user interactions
6. Update documentation in README.md
7. Test thoroughly in light and dark modes
8. Submit pull request with detailed description

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Tailwind CSS patterns with dark mode classes
- Implement proper error handling
- Add notifications for user interactions
- Use semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Follow React best practices with hooks
- Maintain consistent component structure
